  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Special Relativity</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Special relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein in 1905 that describes the behavior of objects moving at
    constant velocities. Special relativity is based on two fundamental principles: the laws of physics are the same for
    all inertial observers, and the speed of light is always constant. These principles lead to some counterintuitive
    effects, such as time dilation and length contraction, which mean that time and space appear to be different for
    observers moving at different velocities. Special relativity has been confirmed by many experiments, and is a
    fundamental part of modern physics.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>General Relativity</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    General relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein in 1915 that describes the behavior of objects in the
    presence of gravitational fields. General relativity is based on the idea that gravity is not a force, but rather a
    curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of massive objects. General relativity has been confirmed by many
    experiments, including the observation of gravitational waves, and is a fundamental part of modern physics.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Time Dilation</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Time dilation is a consequence of special relativity, and describes how time appears to be different for observers
    moving at different velocities. Time dilation means that time appears to slow down for objects that are moving at
    high speeds relative to a stationary observer. This effect has been confirmed by many experiments, including the
    observation of muons produced in the Earth's atmosphere.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Length Contraction</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Length contraction is a consequence of special relativity, and describes how space appears to be different for
    observers moving at different velocities. Length contraction means that objects appear to be shorter when they are
    moving at high speeds relative to a stationary observer. This effect has also been confirmed by many experiments.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Relativistic Energy and Momentum</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Relativistic energy and momentum are quantities that are related to an object's mass and velocity, and change as an
    object approaches the speed of light. As an object's velocity increases, its energy and momentum also increase, and
    the object's mass appears to increase as well. This effect has been confirmed by many experiments, and is a
    fundamental part of special relativity.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Black Holes</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Black holes are objects with such strong gravitational fields that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.
    Black holes are predicted by general relativity, and are formed when massive stars collapse in on themselves. Black
    holes have been observed indirectly through their effects on nearby objects, and the observation of gravitational
    waves has provided strong evidence for their existence.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Gravitational Waves</b></h1>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as
    merging black holes or neutron stars. Gravitational waves were predicted by general relativity in 1916, but were not
    observed directly until 2015. The observation of gravitational waves has
