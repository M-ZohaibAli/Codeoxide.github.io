    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Wave-Particle Duality</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum physics that states that particles can exhibit both
      wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means that particles, such as electrons and photons, can be described
      as waves with a certain wavelength and frequency, as well as particles with a certain position and momentum. The
      wave-particle duality is supported by various experimental evidence, such as the double-slit experiment, where a
      beam of electrons or photons is observed to exhibit interference patterns, similar to the patterns produced by
      waves. The wave-particle duality has important implications for the understanding of the behavior of matter and
      energy at the atomic and subatomic levels, as well as the development of technology based on quantum principles,
      such as quantum computing.
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quantum States and Superposition</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quantum states and superposition refer to the description of a particle's state using wave functions and the
      ability for particles to exist in multiple states at once. A quantum state is a mathematical description of a
      particle's properties, such as its position, momentum, and spin, at a given moment in time. Superposition refers
      to the ability of particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with a certain probability. The
      superposition of states is a fundamental concept in quantum physics and is supported by experimental evidence,
      such as the Stern-Gerlach experiment, where the spin of a particle is observed to have two possible outcomes, even
      when the particle is in a superposition of spin states. Quantum states and superposition are important for the
      development of quantum computing, where multiple quantum bits can exist in superposition and enable the processing
      of vast amounts of information.
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Uncertainty Principle</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum physics that states that the more precisely one
      knows a particle's position, the less precisely one can know its momentum, and vice versa. This means that there
      is a fundamental limit to the precision with which both position and momentum can be measured. The uncertainty
      principle arises from the wave-like nature of particles, where the position and momentum of a particle are
      described by its wave function. The uncertainty principle has important implications for the behavior of matter
      and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels, and is a fundamental principle in the development of quantum
      mechanics.
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Entanglement</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Entanglement is the phenomenon where two or more particles can become correlated in such a way that their states
      are dependent on one another, even at a distance. This means that the properties of one particle can be
      instantaneously determined by measuring the properties of another particle, even if the particles are separated by
      large distances. Entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum physics and has been experimentally observed in
      various systems, such as photons and ions. Entanglement has important implications for the development of quantum
      technologies, such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing.
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quantum Tunneling</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quantum tunneling is the ability of particles to pass through potential energy barriers even though they do not
      have enough energy to overcome the barrier. This phenomenon is due to the wave-like nature of particles
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quantum Mechanics</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and
      subatomic levels. Quantum mechanics is based on the principles of wave-particle duality, superposition, and
      uncertainty, and provides a mathematical framework for the description and prediction of quantum phenomena. The
      development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized our understanding of the physical world,
      and has had profound implications for the development of technology, such as transistors, lasers, and nuclear
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quantum Field Theory</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quantum field theory is a theoretical framework that combines quantum mechanics with special relativity, and
      describes the behavior of quantum fields, such as the electromagnetic field, at the subatomic level. Quantum field
      theory is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, and provides a way to calculate the probabilities of
      various particle interactions. Quantum field theory is a fundamental theory in modern physics, and has had
      important applications in the development of high-energy particle accelerators and the study of the early
      universe.
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quantum Electrodynamics</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory that describes the behavior of the electromagnetic field
      and its interactions with charged particles. QED is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special
      relativity, and provides a framework for the calculation of the probabilities of various electromagnetic
      interactions. QED is one of the most successful theories in physics, and has been tested to an extremely high
      degree of precision through experiments such as the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quantum Gravity</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quantum gravity is a theoretical framework that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, and
      describes the behavior of gravity at the subatomic level. Quantum gravity is a challenging problem in theoretical
      physics, as the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity are fundamentally incompatible. Various
      approaches to quantum gravity have been proposed, such as string theory and loop quantum gravity, but a complete
      and satisfactory theory of quantum gravity has yet to be developed. The development of a theory of quantum gravity
      would have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of space and time, and the behavior of the
      universe at its most fundamental level.
