  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Evolution</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Stellar evolution is the study of how stars are born, evolve, and eventually die. Stars are born in dense clouds of
    gas and dust called nebulae, where gravity causes the material to condense and heat up. Once the temperature and
    pressure in the core of a young star reach a certain threshold, nuclear fusion reactions begin, which release huge
    amounts of energy and enable the star to shine. Over time, a star's fuel supply will be exhausted, and it will
    eventually die, either by cooling down and becoming a white dwarf, exploding as a supernova and leaving behind a
    neutron star or black hole, or through other mechanisms depending on its mass and other characteristics. Stellar
    evolution is a fascinating field that allows astronomers to learn about the physical processes that govern the
    behavior of stars, and how they shape the universe around us.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Galaxies</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Galaxies are vast systems of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The study
    of galaxies involves understanding their structure, dynamics, and evolution over time. One of the most important
    discoveries in galactic astronomy is that galaxies are not static entities, but are constantly evolving through
    processes such as mergers, accretion of gas, and star formation. Astronomers also study the distribution of matter
    within galaxies, including the mysterious dark matter that makes up the majority of a galaxy's mass. By studying
    galaxies across the universe, astronomers can learn about the history and evolution of the cosmos as a whole.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Black Holes</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Black holes are some of the most fascinating and enigmatic objects in the universe. They are formed when a massive
    star collapses in on itself, creating a region of space where the gravitational field is so strong that nothing can
    escape, not even light. This means that black holes are essentially invisible, except for their effects on nearby
    matter. Astrophysicists study black holes to understand their properties, such as their mass, spin, and accretion
    disk, as well as the effects of black holes on the surrounding space. Black holes also play a key role in the
    evolution of galaxies, as they can have a profound effect on the behavior of stars and other matter around them.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cosmology</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Cosmology is the study of the structure, origin, and evolution of the universe as a whole. This includes
    understanding the large-scale distribution of matter and energy, the cosmic microwave background radiation, the
    expansion of the universe, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy. Cosmologists use a variety of
    techniques, including observations of distant galaxies and quasars, measurements of the cosmic microwave background,
    and computer simulations, to build models of the universe and test them against data. Cosmology has made some of the
    most profound discoveries in modern astronomy, including the Big Bang theory and the accelerating expansion of the
    universe.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Exoplanets</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Exoplanets are planets outside of our solar system that orbit other stars. The study of exoplanets involves
    understanding their formation, characteristics, and potential



  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>High-Energy Astrophysics</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    High-energy astrophysics is the study of the most energetic phenomena in the universe, including supernovae,
    gamma-ray bursts, and active galactic nuclei. These events release huge amounts of energy in the form of radiation
    and particles, and can have a profound effect on the surrounding space. High-energy astrophysics is a relatively new
    field that has been enabled by advances in technology, including the development of space telescopes and detectors
    capable of measuring very high-energy radiation. By studying these extreme events, astrophysicists can gain insights
    into the physics of matter under extreme conditions, and learn about the evolution of galaxies and the universe as a
    whole.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Interstellar Medium</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    The interstellar medium is the gas and dust that fills the space between stars in a galaxy. It is composed primarily
    of hydrogen and helium, along with trace amounts of other elements. The study of the interstellar medium involves
    understanding its physical properties, including its temperature, density, and magnetic fields, as well as its role
    in star formation and galactic evolution. The interstellar medium also plays a key role in the chemical evolution of
    the universe, as it is the site of chemical reactions that produce heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and
    oxygen.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Gravitational Waves</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are produced by the acceleration of massive objects,
    such as colliding black holes or neutron stars. They were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, but
    were not directly detected until 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The study
    of gravitational waves is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the
    universe. By measuring the properties of gravitational waves, such as their frequency and amplitude, astrophysicists
    can learn about the characteristics of the objects that produced them, and test the predictions of general
    relativity in extreme regimes.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Dark Matter</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe. It does not interact
    with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, which makes it invisible to telescopes. However, its
    presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the rotation curves of galaxies
    and the large-scale structure of the universe. The study of dark matter involves understanding its properties,
    including its distribution, density, and particle nature. Many theories have been proposed to explain the nature of
    dark matter, including the existence of undiscovered particles or modifications to the laws of gravity.
  </div>
  <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neutron Stars</b></h1>
  <br>
  <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
    Neutron stars are extremely dense objects that form when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion and its core
    collapses. They are composed primarily of neutrons, which are packed together at incredibly high densities. Neutron
    stars have some of the most extreme physical properties in the universe, including strong magnetic fields, rapid
    rotation, and the ability to emit intense radiation in the form of X-rays and gamma rays. The study of neutron
