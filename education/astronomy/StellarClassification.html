    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Classification: Categorizing the Stars</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stellar classification is the process of categorizing stars based on their observed characteristics,
      such as temperature, luminosity, spectral lines, and size. The most commonly used stellar classification
      system is the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which classifies stars into different spectral types using the
      letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Each spectral type represents a range of temperatures, with O-type
      stars being the hottest and M-type stars being the coolest. Stellar classification helps astronomers
      understand the diverse population of stars and provides valuable insights into their physical properties
      and evolutionary stages.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Main Sequence Stars: The Stellar Backbone</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Main sequence stars are the most common type of stars and represent the stable stage in their evolution.
      These stars, including our Sun, fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores, releasing vast amounts of
      energy in the process. Main sequence stars are characterized by a balance between the inward pull of
      gravity and the outward pressure from nuclear fusion. The mass of a main sequence star determines its
      size, temperature, and luminosity, following a well-defined relationship known as the mass-luminosity
      relationship. The main sequence phase is a crucial stage in the life of a star and provides the energy
      source for their long-lasting existence.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Evolution: From Birth to Death</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stellar evolution is the process by which stars change over time, from their formation to their eventual
      demise. It is influenced by factors such as mass, composition, and initial conditions. The evolution of
      a star is determined by the interplay between gravity, nuclear fusion, and radiation pressure. The exact
      path a star takes during its evolution depends on its initial mass. Low-mass stars, like red dwarfs,
      have a much longer lifespan and evolve differently than high-mass stars, which undergo more dramatic
      transformations and may end their lives as supernovae, neutron stars, or even black holes. Stellar
      evolution encompasses various stages, including protostars, main sequence stars, red giants, white
      dwarfs, and more.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Birth: From Nebulae to Protostars</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stars are born within vast regions of gas and dust called nebulae. Nebulae are gravitational nurseries
      where molecular clouds collapse under their own gravity, forming dense cores. Within these cores,
      material gathers, and the temperature and density increase. As the core contracts, it heats up,
      eventually reaching a point where nuclear fusion ignites, marking the birth of a protostar. Protostars
      are young, contracting objects that are still gathering mass from their surrounding material. They emit
      intense radiation and drive powerful outflows of gas. Over time, the protostar evolves into a stable
      main sequence star, where nuclear fusion sustains it for millions or billions of years.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Death: Exploring the Final Stages</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stars eventually exhaust their nuclear fuel and go through a series of transformations in their final
      stages. Low-mass stars, like the Sun, expand

      into red giants as their core runs out of hydrogen and begins fusing helium. Red giants shed their outer
      layers into space, forming beautiful planetary nebulae, while their core collapses to form a dense white
      dwarf. High-mass stars, on the other hand, undergo more explosive endings. They explode in brilliant
      supernovae, releasing tremendous amounts of energy and synthesizing heavier elements. The remnants of
      these explosions can result in neutron stars or black holes, depending on the mass of the progenitor
      star. Stellar death is a vital part of the cosmic cycle, enriching the universe with new elements and
      paving the way for future generations of stars.
    </div>

    Stellar classification and evolution provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the life cycles of
    stars. By studying their spectral properties, characteristics, and evolutionary paths, astronomers can piece
    together the story of the universe and gain insights into its past, present, and future. The fascinating
    journey of stars, from their birth in nebulae to their spectacular transformations and ultimate fate,
    showcases the remarkable processes and forces at work in the cosmos.
