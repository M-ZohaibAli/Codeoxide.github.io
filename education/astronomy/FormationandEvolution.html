    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Formation of Planetary Systems: From Dust to Planets</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The formation of planetary systems is a complex and fascinating process that begins in the protoplanetary
      disk surrounding a young star. It starts with a dense cloud of gas and dust in a stellar nursery. As gravity
      causes the cloud to collapse, it forms a rotating disk known as a protoplanetary disk. Within this disk,
      dust particles collide and stick together, gradually growing into planetesimals. Planetesimals are small
      rocky or icy bodies that serve as building blocks for planets. Through further collisions and accretion,
      these planetesimals eventually become protoplanets, forming a diverse range of planetary systems with
      different compositions, sizes, and orbital configurations.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Planetary Migration: Rearranging the Cosmic Neighborhood</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Planetary migration is a crucial process in the evolution of planetary systems. It refers to the movement of
      planets from their initial formation locations to new orbital positions. Several mechanisms can cause
      planetary migration, including gravitational interactions with other planets, tidal forces from the
      protoplanetary disk, and resonances. Migration can lead to the reshuffling of planetary orbits, the
      formation of resonant chains, and even the ejection of planets from the system. The study of planetary
      migration helps explain the diversity of planetary systems and provides insights into the formation and
      evolution of our own solar system.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Planet Formation: Rocky vs. Gas Giants</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Planet formation can give rise to a variety of planets with different compositions. The two main types of
      planets are rocky planets, like Earth, and gas giants, like Jupiter. Rocky planets are formed closer to
      their host star, where temperatures are high enough for volatile substances to evaporate, leaving behind
      mainly rocky and metallic materials. Gas giants, on the other hand, form farther from the star, where
      temperatures are low enough for volatile gases, such as hydrogen and helium, to condense into massive
      atmospheres. The formation of gas giants often involves the accumulation of a solid core followed by the
      rapid accretion of gas from the protoplanetary disk.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolution of Planetary Systems: Dynamics and Stability</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Once planetary systems have formed, they continue to evolve under the influence of gravitational
      interactions and other external factors. The long-term stability of planetary systems depends on various
      factors, including the mass and distribution of planets, their orbital resonances, and the presence of other
      stars or massive objects in the vicinity. Chaotic and resonant interactions between planets can lead to
      orbital instabilities, causing some planets to be ejected from the system or undergo significant changes in
      their orbits. Understanding the dynamics and stability of planetary systems helps astronomers explain the
      observed diversity of exoplanetary systems and predict their long-term evolution.
    </div>

    The formation and evolution of planetary systems offer a captivating glimpse into the processes that shape the
    cosmic landscape. Through the accumulation of dust, the growth of planetesimals, and the dynamic interactions
    between planets, diverse planetary systems emerge, each with its own unique set of characteristics. By studying
    the formation and evolution of planetary systems, astronomers gain insights into the origins of our own solar
    system and the abundance of exoplanets discovered throughout the universe.
