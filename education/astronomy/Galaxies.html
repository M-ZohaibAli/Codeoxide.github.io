    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Galaxies and Cosmology</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Galaxies are vast cosmic structures that house billions or even trillions of stars, as well as gas, dust,
      and other celestial objects. They come in various shapes and sizes, and their study provides invaluable
      insights into the formation and evolution of the universe. Cosmology, on the other hand, is the branch of
      astronomy that explores the origin, structure, and evolution of the universe as a whole. Let's embark on a
      journey to understand the captivating world of galaxies and the fascinating field of cosmology.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Glimpse into Galaxies</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Galaxies are vast assemblages of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. They come in
      different types, including spiral galaxies with beautiful arms, elliptical galaxies with a smooth and
      rounded shape, and irregular galaxies with no defined structure. Galaxies host a variety of celestial
      objects, such as star clusters, nebulae, and supermassive black holes at their centers.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Formation of Galaxies</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The formation of galaxies is a complex process that spans billions of years. According to the prevailing
      cosmological model, galaxies are believed to have formed from the gravitational collapse of denser regions
      within the early universe. Over time, these collapsed regions attracted more matter, including gas and dust,
      eventually giving rise to the structures we observe today. The interplay between dark matter, baryonic
      matter, and cosmic expansion shapes the formation and distribution of galaxies on large scales.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Milky Way: Our Home Galaxy</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Milky Way is our home galaxy, a vast spiral galaxy with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years. We
      reside in one of its spiral arms, known as the Orion Arm or Local Spur. The Milky Way is home to billions of
      stars, including our Sun, and it also hosts various other celestial objects, such as nebulae and star
      clusters. Studying the Milky Way provides us with valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of
      galaxies.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Galaxy Clusters</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Galaxies rarely exist in isolation but rather cluster together due to their mutual gravitational attraction.
      Galaxy clusters are immense structures containing hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by
      gravity. They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe. The study of galaxy
      clusters provides valuable information about the distribution of matter, dark matter, and the evolution of
      large-scale structures in the cosmos.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Active Galactic Nuclei and Quasars</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Some galaxies host extremely luminous and energetic centers known as active galactic nuclei (AGN). AGNs are
      powered by accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes residing at the galaxy's core. When matter
      falls into the black hole, it releases a tremendous amount of energy, creating powerful jets of particles
      and emitting intense radiation. Quasars are the brightest AGNs, visible across

      vast cosmic distances, and they provide valuable insights into the early universe.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Large-Scale Structure of the Universe</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Cosmology aims to understand the large-scale structure of the universe and its evolution over time. Through
      observations, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of galaxies, and the
      measurement of cosmic expansion, scientists have developed the concept of the expanding universe. The
      prevailing theory, known as the Big Bang theory, suggests that the universe originated from an extremely hot
      and dense state and has been expanding ever since.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Dark Matter and Dark Energy</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Although galaxies and their visible matter play a significant role in the cosmos, the universe's composition
      is mostly made up of mysterious dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter is an invisible and elusive form of
      matter that exerts gravitational forces on visible matter, shaping the formation of galaxies and large-scale
      structures. Dark energy, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of energy that drives the accelerated
      expansion of the universe.
    </div>

    Exploring galaxies and delving into cosmology allows us to unravel the mysteries of the universe's origin,
    structure, and evolution. Through advanced telescopes, innovative technologies, and theoretical models,
    scientists continue to push the boundaries of our understanding, paving the way for new discoveries and insights
    into the vast cosmos.
