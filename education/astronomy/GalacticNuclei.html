    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Active Galactic Nuclei: Unleashing Cosmic Power</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are incredibly powerful and energetic phenomena found at the centers of
      galaxies. They are powered by supermassive black holes that accrete large amounts of matter from their
      surroundings. As matter falls into the black hole's gravitational well, it releases tremendous amounts of
      energy in the form of radiation. AGN exhibit a variety of characteristics, including strong emission lines,
      jets, and intense luminosity across multiple wavelengths. These cosmic powerhouses play a significant role
      in galaxy evolution and have a profound impact on their host galaxies.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Quasars: Ancient Beacons of Light</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Quasars, short for quasi-stellar radio sources, are a specific type of active galactic nuclei that exhibit
      exceptionally high luminosity. They were first discovered as radio sources but are now known to emit
      radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Quasars are believed to be powered by accretion disks
      around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. These incredibly bright objects are often
      observed at vast distances, allowing us to peer back in time and study the early universe. Quasars provide
      valuable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies, as well as the nature of supermassive black
      holes.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Active Galactic Nuclei exhibit several distinctive properties that set them apart from regular galaxies. One
      key characteristic is their high luminosity, often outshining the entire galaxy in which they reside. AGN
      emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio waves, infrared, optical, X-rays, and
      even gamma rays. They also display strong emission lines in their spectra, indicating the presence of highly
      ionized gas in their vicinity. Additionally, AGN often generate powerful jets of particles and
      electromagnetic radiation, extending over vast distances and interacting with the surrounding intergalactic
      medium.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Types of Active Galactic Nuclei</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      There are several types of Active Galactic Nuclei, each characterized by different observational properties
      and physical mechanisms. The main types include Seyfert galaxies, which are spiral galaxies with bright
      nuclei; radio galaxies, which emit strong radio waves and exhibit extended radio structures; blazars, which
      are AGN with relativistic jets pointed directly at Earth; and quasars, which are the most luminous and
      distant type of AGN. Each type represents a different stage or orientation of the central black hole and its
      accretion disk, offering unique insights into the processes occurring within AGN.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>The Central Engine: Supermassive Black Holes</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      At the heart of Active Galactic Nuclei lies a supermassive black hole, typically millions or billions of
      times more massive than the Sun. These black holes are believed to form and grow through the accretion of
      matter from their surroundings. As matter falls into the black hole's gravitational pull, it forms a
      swirling disk known as an accretion disk. The intense gravitational forces and friction within the

      disk cause the matter to heat up and emit copious amounts of energy, powering the AGN. The accretion process
      releases an enormous amount of radiation and generates the observed characteristics of AGN.
    </div>

    Active Galactic Nuclei and quasars are captivating cosmic phenomena that astound astronomers with their immense
    power and energetic nature. By studying these objects, scientists gain valuable insights into the nature of
    black holes, galaxy evolution, and the early universe. The ongoing research and exploration of AGN and quasars
    continue to deepen our understanding of the cosmos and its awe-inspiring phenomena.
