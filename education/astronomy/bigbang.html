    <h1 class="text-center"><b>The Big Bang Theory</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing scientific model that describes the origin and early evolution of the
      universe. It proposes that the universe began as a singularity—a point of infinite density and
      temperature—and has been expanding and evolving ever since. This groundbreaking theory has revolutionized
      our understanding of the cosmos and provides a framework for explaining a wide range of phenomena. Let's
      delve into the fascinating world of The Big Bang Theory and explore its key concepts and implications.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Early Universe: Singularity and Expansion</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      According to The Big Bang Theory, the universe emerged from a singularity—an incredibly hot and dense
      state—approximately 13.8 billion years ago. At this point, all matter, energy, space, and time were
      concentrated in a single point. Then, an event known as cosmic inflation caused a rapid expansion, leading
      to the formation of the observable universe as we know it. The expansion continues to this day, with
      galaxies and clusters moving away from each other.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      One of the key pieces of evidence supporting The Big Bang Theory is the discovery of the cosmic microwave
      background radiation (CMB). This faint radiation is present throughout the universe and is a remnant of the
      hot, dense early universe. The CMB provides a snapshot of the universe when it became transparent to light,
      about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Its precise measurements have allowed scientists to validate the
      theory and gain insights into the composition and age of the universe.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Formation of Matter and Nucleosynthesis</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      As the universe expanded and cooled, the intense energy transformed into subatomic particles, such as
      protons, neutrons, and electrons. During a process known as nucleosynthesis, these particles combined to
      form the first atomic nuclei of light elements like hydrogen and helium. This era of nucleosynthesis, which
      occurred within a few minutes of the Big Bang, laid the foundation for the subsequent formation of stars,
      galaxies, and the diverse elements found in the universe today.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Formation of Structure: Galaxies and Clusters</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The gravitational forces acting on slight density fluctuations in the early universe played a crucial role
      in the formation of structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Over time, these fluctuations grew,
      leading to the formation of vast cosmic web-like structures consisting of filaments, voids, and
      superclusters of galaxies. The study of cosmic microwave background radiation, large-scale surveys, and
      simulations helps us understand the growth and evolution of cosmic structures.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Expansion and Dark Energy</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Observations in the late 20th century revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This
      phenomenon is attributed to a mysterious force known as dark energy. Dark energy, which is distinct from
      dark matter, is a form of energy that permeates space and exerts negative pressure, driving the accelerated
      expansion. The discovery of dark energy has raised

      new questions and challenges in understanding the fundamental nature of the universe.
    </div>

    The Big Bang Theory has transformed our understanding of the universe, its origins, and its subsequent
    evolution. While it provides a comprehensive framework for explaining many observed phenomena, there are still
    unanswered questions, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the ultimate fate of the universe, and
    what preceded the Big Bang. Scientists continue to explore these mysteries, pushing the boundaries of our
    knowledge and deepening our appreciation for the vast and complex cosmos.
