    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stars and Stellar Evolution</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stars are fascinating celestial objects that have captivated humanity for centuries. These luminous balls of
      gas are not only mesmerizing to observe but also play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of
      galaxies. Stellar evolution, the life cycle of a star, encompasses various stages and processes that shape
      its characteristics and ultimately determine its fate. Let's explore the captivating world of stars and
      delve into the mysteries of stellar evolution.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Formation of Stars</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stars are born from vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. Within these nebulae, gravitational forces
      cause the material to collapse under its own weight, leading to the formation of a protostar. As the
      protostar continues to accrete mass, its core becomes denser and hotter, eventually reaching a critical
      temperature and pressure that ignites nuclear fusion, marking the birth of a star.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Main Sequence Stars</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The main sequence phase is the longest and most stable stage in a star's life. During this phase, the star
      fuses hydrogen atoms in its core to form helium through the process of nuclear fusion. The energy generated
      by this fusion counteracts the gravitational forces pulling the star inward, resulting in a state of
      equilibrium. The duration of the main sequence phase depends on the star's mass, with more massive stars
      having shorter lifetimes.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Red Giants and Supergiants</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      As a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, its core begins to contract while the outer layers expand. This
      expansion leads to the formation of a red giant or supergiant, depending on the star's initial mass. Red
      giants are relatively low-mass stars, while supergiants are massive stars. These evolved stars exhibit
      significant changes in size, luminosity, and temperature. During this phase, some red giants expel their
      outer layers, forming a beautiful planetary nebula.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>White Dwarfs</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Once a red giant sheds its outer layers, it leaves behind a dense and hot core called a white dwarf. White
      dwarfs are incredibly dense, with a mass comparable to that of the Sun but a size similar to that of Earth.
      These stellar remnants gradually cool over billions of years, eventually fading into a dim, non-luminous
      state known as a black dwarf.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Supernovae</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Massive stars, those with significantly more mass than the Sun, end their lives in a spectacular explosion
      called a supernova. During a supernova, the star undergoes a catastrophic collapse, releasing an immense
      amount of energy in the process. The explosion can briefly outshine entire galaxies and scatter heavy
      elements throughout space, enriching the interstellar medium with these building blocks for future star
      formation.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neutron Stars and Black Holes</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">


      The remnants of supernovae depend on the mass of the progenitor star. If the core of the star is between
      about 1.4 and 3 times the mass of the Sun, it collapses into an incredibly dense object known as a neutron
      star. Neutron stars are only a few miles in diameter but possess immense gravity. For more massive stars,
      the collapse leads to the formation of a black holeâ€”a region of spacetime with gravitational forces so
      strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its grasp.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Clusters and Galaxies</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Stars are not solitary objects but often form in clusters within galaxies. Stellar clusters can be open or
      globular, and they provide valuable information about the formation and evolution of stars. Furthermore,
      galaxies consist of billions or even trillions of stars bound together by gravity. The study of stars within
      galaxies helps us understand the larger structures and dynamics of the universe.
