    <h1 class="text-center"><b>The Milky Way Galaxy:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Milky Way galaxy is our home in the vastness of the universe. It is a spiral galaxy, consisting of
      billions of stars, planets, and other celestial objects. Let's embark on a cosmic journey to explore the
      structure, formation, and fascinating features of our magnificent galaxy, the Milky Way.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Galactic Structure:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Milky Way has a distinct structure characterized by its spiral arms, central bulge, and a disk that
      contains most of its stars. The spiral arms, composed of gas, dust, and young stars, extend from the central
      region, creating a mesmerizing spiral pattern when viewed from afar. The galaxy also features a halo, which
      consists of globular clusters and dark matter.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Size and Scale:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Milky Way is vast, with a diameter of about 100,000 light-years and a thickness of around 1,000
      light-years. It is estimated to contain over 100 billion stars, along with numerous planets, asteroids, and
      comets. Our solar system resides in one of the spiral arms, known as the Orion Arm or the Local Spur.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Formation and Evolution:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Milky Way formed billions of years ago through the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud.
      Over time, as gas and dust accumulated in the center, the intense gravitational forces led to the formation
      of stars and the assembly of the galactic disk. Through interactions with other galaxies and the ongoing
      process of star formation and stellar evolution, the Milky Way continues to evolve.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Stellar Population:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The Milky Way hosts a diverse population of stars, each with its own characteristics and life cycle. The
      galactic disk contains a mixture of young, hot, and massive stars as well as older, cooler stars. The
      central bulge consists of older stars, while the halo contains globular clusters, which are ancient
      collections of stars that formed early in the galaxy's history.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Spiral Arms and Star Formation:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The spiral arms of the Milky Way are regions of active star formation. Dense clouds of gas and dust within
      the arms provide the raw materials for new stars to be born. The process of star formation involves the
      gravitational collapse of these clouds, followed by the formation of protostars, and eventually, the
      ignition of nuclear fusion. The spiral arms serve as nurseries for young, hot stars.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Supermassive Black Hole:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      At the center of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). This black
      hole has a mass equivalent to millions of suns and exerts a powerful gravitational pull. Although it cannot
      be directly observed, its presence is inferred from the motion of stars and gas clouds around it. Sgr A*
      influences the dynamics of the galaxy and plays a crucial role in its evolution.</div>

    <h1 class="text
        
        -center"><b>Interstellar Medium:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The space between the stars in the Milky Way is filled with a diffuse mixture of gas and dust called the
      interstellar medium (ISM). The ISM contains various elements, molecules, and compounds, including hydrogen,
      helium, and complex organic molecules. It serves as the reservoir for future star formation and is also
      responsible for the beautiful nebulae and interstellar clouds observed within the galaxy.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Galactic Cannibalism and Mergers:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Throughout its history, the Milky Way has interacted and merged with other galaxies. These interactions,
      often referred to as galactic cannibalism or mergers, can dramatically reshape the structure of the galaxy.
      They trigger intense bursts of star formation, disturb the orbits of stars, and lead to the formation of new
      structures, such as tidal tails and stellar streams.</div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>The Galactic Habitable Zone:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The concept of the galactic habitable zone suggests that certain regions within the Milky Way may be more
      conducive to the development and sustainability of life. Factors such as the abundance of heavy elements,
      the presence of stable orbits, and the avoidance of dangerous phenomena like supernovae and gamma-ray bursts
      play a role in determining the potential habitability of different regions within our galaxy.</div>
