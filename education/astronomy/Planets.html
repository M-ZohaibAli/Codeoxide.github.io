    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Planets and Moons</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">


      <p>Planets and moons are captivating celestial bodies that populate our Solar System. From the rocky
        surfaces of terrestrial planets to the vast gas giants and the diverse landscapes of moons, these
        objects offer intriguing insights into the processes that shape planetary systems. Let's delve into the
        fascinating world of planets and moons and explore their unique features and characteristics.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      <h1><b>Terrestrial Planets</b></h1>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>1. Mercury:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">




      Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in our Solar System. It has a rocky surface
      covered in craters, and its thin atmosphere offers little protection from the intense solar radiation.
      Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations, with scorching hot days and freezing cold nights.</p>

      <br>
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>2.Venus:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Venus is often referred to as Earth's &quot;sister planet&quot; due to its similar size and composition. It
      has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it
      the hottest planet in our Solar System. Venus has a harsh environment with high surface temperatures and a
      dense layer of clouds that obscures its surface from direct observation.</p>

      <br>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>3.Earth:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Earth, our home planet, is the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of
      environments, including vast oceans, lush forests, and towering mountains. Earth's atmosphere contains
      oxygen and protects life by regulating temperature and shielding from harmful solar radiation.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>4.Mars:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Mars, often called the &quot;Red Planet&quot; due to its reddish appearance, has intrigued scientists
      for its potential to harbor life. It has a thin atmosphere and a cold, desert-like surface, with
      features such as the towering Olympus Mons volcano and the vast Valles Marineris canyon system. Mars has
      polar ice caps and evidence of ancient riverbeds, suggesting a more hospitable past.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      <h1><b>Gas Giants:</b></h1>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>5.Jupiter:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a tumultuous atmosphere dominated by
      powerful storms and the iconic Great Red Spot. It has a complex system of rings and a diverse family
      of moons. Jupiter's immense size and strong gravitational influence have played a significant role
      in shaping the dynamics of the Solar System.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>6.Saturn:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, composed of countless icy particles. It is the
      second-largest planet and has a prominent set of rings that make it a breathtaking sight. Saturn's
      atmosphere is adorned with swirling storms, and it has a diverse collection of moons, including the
      intriguing Titan with its thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Uranus</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Uranus is an ice giant with a unique feature: its axis of rotation is tilted on its side, causing it
      to appear to roll along its orbit. This unique orientation gives Uranus its distinct appearance. It
      has a relatively featureless atmosphere and a collection of icy moons.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neptune</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Neptune, the farthest known planet in our Solar System, is also an ice giant. It has a dynamic
      atmosphere with storms and high winds, including the famous Great Dark Spot. Neptune's moon Triton
      exhibits geysers and a retrograde orbit, suggesting a captured object from the Kuiper Belt.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      <h1>Moons:</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Moons are natural satellites that orbit planets. They come in various sizes, compositions, and have
      diverse geological features. Here are some notable moons within our Solar System:</p>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>1. Earth's Moon:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">


      Earth's Moon is the closest celestial object to our planet. It has a desolate surface covered in
      impact craters, ancient lava flows, and mountain ranges. The Moon's gravitational pull causes tides
      on Earth and has played a significant role in shaping its geological history.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>2. Jupiter's Moon:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Jupiter boasts a rich family of moons, including the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
      Callisto. These moons exhibit a wide range of features, from Io's</p>

      <p> volcanic activity to Europa's potential subsurface ocean, making them fascinating subjects for
        exploration.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>3. Saturn's Moon:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Saturn's moon Titan stands out with its thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane and ethane.
      Enceladus, another moon of Saturn, has geysers that spew water vapor into space, suggesting the
      presence of subsurface oceans.</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="text-center"><b>4. Mars Moon:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">

      Mars has two small moons named Phobos and Deimos. These irregularly shaped moons are thought to be
      captured asteroids and provide additional insights into the dynamics of the Martian system.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Exploration of these planets and moons has been conducted through robotic missions, including
      orbiters, landers, and flybys. These missions have provided invaluable data and imagery, expanding
      our knowledge of their geology, atmospheres, and potential for habitability.</p>

    <p>Studying planets and moons within our Solar System not only deepens our understanding of our cosmic
      neighborhood but also serves as a stepping stone in the search for life beyond Earth and in our
      exploration of planetary systems in the vast expanse of the universe.</p>
