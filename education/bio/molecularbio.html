            adverse conditions. It involves molecular mechanisms that maintain cellular homeostasis, repair damaged
            molecules, and activate stress response pathways. Cellular resilience is important for cell survival and the
            adaptation to changing environments.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cellular Adaptation:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cellular Adaptation is the process by which cells adjust their structure and function in response to changes
            in their environment. It includes mechanisms such as changes in gene expression, alterations in cell shape,
            and metabolic adjustments. Cellular adaptation allows cells to survive and thrive in different conditions.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cellular Homeostasis:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cellular Homeostasis refers to the maintenance of stable internal conditions within cells, despite external
            fluctuations. It involves regulatory mechanisms that balance processes such as temperature, pH, ion
            concentration, and nutrient levels. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for cell function, survival, and overall
            organismal well-being.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cellular Senescence:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cellular Senescence is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to various stresses,
            including DNA damage and telomere shortening. It is characterized by changes in cell morphology and the
            secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. Cellular senescence plays a role in aging, tissue regeneration, and
            cancer prevention.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cellular Immunity:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cellular Immunity, also known as cell-mediated immunity, is a branch of the immune system that involves the
            activation of immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a critical role in
            defense against intracellular pathogens, tumor surveillance, and immune responses to tissue transplantation.
