            plants, their diversification, and the evolution of key adaptations such as vascular tissues and seeds.
            Plant evolution helps in understanding the patterns of plant diversity and the processes that have shaped
            the plant kingdom over millions of years.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Plant Reproduction:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Plant Reproduction focuses on the mechanisms by which plants reproduce and produce offspring. It explores
            both sexual and asexual reproduction in plants, including the formation of flowers, pollination,
            fertilization, and seed development. Understanding plant reproduction is essential for plant breeding, seed
            production, and conservation efforts.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Plant Biotechnology:</b></ h1>
            <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
                Plant Biotechnology applies biological techniques to manipulate and improve plants for various purposes.
                It involves genetic engineering, tissue culture, and molecular breeding methods. Plant biotechnology has
                applications in crop improvement, pharmaceutical production, biofuel development, and environmental
                remediation.
