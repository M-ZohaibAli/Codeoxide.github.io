        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cell Biology is the study of cells, the fundamental units of life. It focuses on the structure, function,
            and organization of cells, as well as their interactions with other cells and their environment. Cell
            Biology encompasses various subfields, including molecular biology, genetics, and physiology, to understand
            the complex processes that occur within cells.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cell Structure:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cell Structure refers to the components and organization of a cell. It involves studying the different
            organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and others.
            Understanding cell structure is crucial for comprehending the functions and processes that occur within
            cells.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cell Membrane:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            The Cell Membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a vital structure that surrounds the cell and acts
            as a barrier between the internal and external environment. It regulates the movement of substances in and
            out of the cell, allowing for selective transport and maintaining cell homeostasis.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cell Cycle:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            The Cell Cycle represents the series of events that a cell undergoes as it grows and divides into two
            daughter cells. It consists of interphase (G1, S, and G2 phases) and the mitotic phase (prophase, metaphase,
            anaphase, and telophase). The cell cycle is tightly regulated to ensure accurate DNA replication and cell
            division.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>DNA Replication:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            DNA Replication is the process by which a cell duplicates its DNA prior to cell division. It involves
            unwinding and separating the DNA strands, and the synthesis of complementary strands using the existing
            strands as templates. DNA replication is a highly accurate process and is essential for the inheritance of
            genetic information.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Gene Expression:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Gene Expression refers to the process by which information encoded in genes is used to synthesize functional
            gene products, such as proteins or non-coding RNAs. It involves transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation
            (RNA to protein). Gene expression is tightly regulated and plays a critical role in determining cell
            identity and function.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cell Signaling:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cell Signaling involves the communication between cells through the exchange of chemical signals. These
            signals can be in the form of hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, or other molecules. Cell
            signaling pathways regulate various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, metabolism, and
            cell survival.

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cellular Respiration:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cellular Respiration is the process by which cells convert nutrients, such as glucose, into energy in the
            form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It occurs in the mitochondria and involves three main stages:
            glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Cellular res

            piration is essential for cell survival and functioning.
        </div>

        <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cell Division:</b></h1>
        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cell Division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. It is necessary
            for growth, development, and the replacement of damaged or old cells. Cell division can occur through
            mitosis (for somatic cells) or meiosis (for reproductive cells) and is tightly regulated to maintain genomic
            stability.
        </div>

        <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
            Cellular Metabolism encompasses all the chemical reactions that occur within a cell to maintain life. It
            involves the breakdown of nutrients to produce energy (catabolism) and the synthesis of biomolecules
            (anabolism). Cellular metabolism is tightly regulated and interconnected, allowing cells to balance energy
            production and biosynthesis.
        </div>
