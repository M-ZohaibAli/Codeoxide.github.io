    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Biology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Biology is the study of the processes that have shaped and continue to shape the diversity of
      life on Earth. It explores the mechanisms of evolution, including natural selection, genetic variation, and
      speciation. Evolutionary biology encompasses various fields, such as population genetics, phylogenetics, and
      paleontology.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Natural Selection:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Natural Selection is the fundamental mechanism of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. It refers to the
      differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to variations in their traits. Traits that enhance
      an organism's fitness are more likely to be passed on to future generations. Natural selection leads to the
      adaptation and diversification of species over time.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Adaptive Radiation:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Adaptive Radiation is the diversification of a lineage into multiple ecological niches. It occurs when a
      single ancestral species gives rise to a variety of descendant species with different adaptations. Adaptive
      radiation can lead to the formation of species-rich communities and the exploitation of new habitats or
      resources.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Speciation:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Speciation is the process by which new species arise from existing populations. It occurs when reproductive
      isolation evolves between groups, preventing gene flow. Speciation can happen through various mechanisms,
      such as geographical isolation, genetic divergence, and reproductive barriers. Studying speciation provides
      insights into the origin of biodiversity.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Genetic Variation:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Genetic Variation refers to the differences in genetic material within and between populations. It is the
      raw material for evolution and arises from mutations, genetic recombination, and gene flow. Genetic
      variation provides the basis for natural selection and allows populations to adapt to changing environments.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Phylogenetics:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary relationships among organisms. It involves constructing
      phylogenetic trees or networks that depict the branching patterns of species and their common ancestors.
      Phylogenetic analysis uses molecular data, morphological traits, and other evidence to infer evolutionary
      history and classify organisms.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Homology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Homology refers to the similarity in traits or genetic sequences between different organisms due to a shared
      ancestry. Homologous structures or genes have a common origin, although they may have different functions.
      Homology provides evidence for evolution and helps trace the history of traits across species.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Convergent Evolution:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Convergent Evolution is the independent evolution of similar traits in unrelated species. It occurs when
      different species face similar selective pressures and develop analogous adaptations. Convergent evolution
      often leads to the convergence of morphological or functional traits, despite the absence of a common
      ancestor.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Macroevolution:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">


      Macroevolution is the study of evolutionary patterns and processes that occur above the species level. It
      examines long-term trends, such as the origin of new taxa, the diversification of major groups, and mass
      extinctions. Macroevolutionary studies provide insights into the grand patterns and transformations in the
      history of life.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Microevolution:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Microevolution refers to the small-scale changes in allele frequencies within populations over a short
      period. It encompasses processes such as genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Microevolutionary
      studies focus on understanding how populations adapt and respond to selective pressures in their local
      environments.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Molecular Clock:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Molecular Clock is a concept in evolutionary biology that uses the rate of molecular change to estimate the
      time of divergence between species. It assumes that mutations accumulate in a relatively constant manner
      over time. Molecular clocks are based on genetic sequences and provide estimates of evolutionary events and
      the timing of speciation.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Biogeography:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Biogeography is the study of the distribution of species and ecosystems across geographic space and
      geological time. It investigates the factors that influence species' range limits, patterns of biodiversity,
      and the formation of biogeographic regions. Biogeography integrates evolutionary and ecological processes to
      understand the history and diversity of life on Earth.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Developmental Biology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Developmental Biology, also known as Evo-Devo, examines the genetic and developmental
      mechanisms underlying evolutionary change. It explores how modifications in developmental processes
      contribute to the origin of novel morphological traits and the diversification of organisms. Evo-Devo
      integrates developmental biology and evolutionary genetics.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Co-evolution:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Co-evolution is the reciprocal evolutionary change that occurs between two or more interacting species. It
      can involve predator-prey relationships, host-parasite interactions, or mutualistic associations.
      Co-evolution drives adaptations and counter-adaptations, leading to the evolution of complex ecological
      relationships.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Ecology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Ecology examines how evolutionary processes shape ecological interactions and the distribution
      of species in ecosystems. It investigates the co-evolutionary dynamics between species, the evolution of
      ecological traits, and the influence of ecological factors on evolution. Evolutionary ecology bridges the
      fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Genetics:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Genetics combines principles from genetics and evolutionary biology to study the genetic basis
      of evolutionary change. It explores how genetic variation arises, spreads, and is maintained in populations.
      Evolutionary genetics investigates the role of mutations, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection in
      driving evolution.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Medicine:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Medicine applies evolutionary principles to understand human health and disease. It

      investigates how evolutionary history has shaped the human body's vulnerabilities to certain diseases and
      the impact of modern environments on health. Evolutionary medicine provides insights into the evolutionary
      origins of diseases and guides medical research and practice.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Psychology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Psychology studies how evolutionary processes have influenced human behavior and cognition. It
      examines how natural selection has shaped our psychological traits, such as social behavior, mating
      preferences, and cognitive abilities. Evolutionary psychology provides evolutionary explanations for human
      behavior and contributes to understanding the mind's evolutionary origins.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Conservation:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Conservation aims to preserve and manage biodiversity based on evolutionary principles. It
      recognizes the value of evolutionary processes and patterns in maintaining ecosystem health and resilience.
      Evolutionary conservation involves identifying and protecting evolutionary distinct species and considering
      evolutionary potential in conservation strategies.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Evolutionary Theory:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Evolutionary Theory is the framework that explains the mechanisms and patterns of biological evolution. It
      encompasses concepts such as common ancestry, descent with modification, and the action of natural
      selection. Evolutionary theory provides a unifying explanation for the diversity of life and is supported by
      a wide range of empirical evidence.
