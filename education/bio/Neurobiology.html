    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Introduction to Neurobiology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Neurobiology is a branch of biology that focuses on the study of the nervous system, including its
      structure, function, development, and diseases. It encompasses various sub-disciplines, such as
      neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, and neuropharmacology. Neurobiology aims to understand the
      complex mechanisms underlying neural processes and their role in behavior, cognition, and neurological
      disorders.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neurons and Neural Circuits:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Neurons are the building blocks of the nervous system and are responsible for transmitting and processing
      electrical signals. Neural circuits, composed of interconnected neurons, underlie the communication and
      information processing within the brain and spinal cord. Neurobiology investigates the structure and
      function of neurons and neural circuits, unraveling the intricacies of brain connectivity and neuronal
      communication.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neurotransmitters and Synaptic Transmission:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that enable communication between neurons at specialized junctions
      called synapses. Synaptic transmission involves the release, binding, and removal of neurotransmitters,
      allowing for the transmission of signals across the nervous system. Neurobiology explores the diverse roles
      of neurotransmitters, their receptors, and the mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Sensory Systems:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Sensory systems enable organisms to perceive and respond to the environment. Neurobiology investigates the
      mechanisms of sensory perception, including vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. It examines how
      sensory information is processed, encoded, and integrated within the nervous system, leading to our sensory
      experiences and behavior.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Motor Systems:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Motor systems are responsible for generating and controlling movements. Neurobiology studies the neural
      circuits, motor neurons, and muscle interactions involved in motor control. It explores the coordination,
      planning, and execution of movements, from simple reflexes to complex behaviors and motor learning.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Learning and Memory:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Learning and memory are fundamental processes that allow organisms to acquire and retain information.
      Neurobiology investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation,
      storage, and retrieval. It explores different forms of memory, such as declarative memory, procedural
      memory, and emotional memory, shedding light on how experiences shape behavior.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Development of the Nervous System:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The development of the nervous system is a complex and highly orchestrated process. Neurobiology examines
      the formation of neural progenitor cells, neuronal migration, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and neuronal
      plasticity. It explores the molecular and cellular events that shape the developing brain, leading to the
      establishment of functional neural circuits.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neurological Disorders:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Neurological disorders encompass a range of conditions that affect the structure or function of the nervous
      system, resulting in abnormal behaviors, cognition, or

      physical impairments. Neurobiology investigates the underlying causes, mechanisms, and potential treatments
      for neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and mood
      disorders.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neuroplasticity and Brain Repair:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experiences, learning, and
      injury. Neurobiology explores the mechanisms of neuroplasticity, including synaptic plasticity, dendritic
      remodeling, and neurogenesis. It investigates how the brain can repair and reorganize itself after injury or
      disease, offering potential avenues for neurorehabilitation and recovery.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Neuropharmacology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Neuropharmacology studies the effects of drugs and chemicals on the nervous system. It investigates how
      drugs interact with neuronal receptors, neurotransmitter systems, and signaling pathways, affecting neuronal
      function and behavior. Neuropharmacology plays a critical role in developing medications for neurological
      and psychiatric disorders and understanding the mechanisms of drug addiction and substance abuse.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cognitive Neuroscience:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Cognitive neuroscience explores the neural basis of cognition, including processes such as perception,
      attention, memory, language, and decision-making. It combines neurobiology, psychology, and computational
      modeling to understand how the brain supports cognitive functions. Cognitive neuroscience techniques, such
      as functional MRI and EEG, provide insights into the brain's activity during cognitive tasks and inform our
      understanding of human cognition.
