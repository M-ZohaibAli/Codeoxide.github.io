    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Introduction to Zoology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Zoology is the scientific study of animals, including their classification, structure, behavior, physiology,
      and evolution. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, from the study of microscopic organisms to the
      behavior of complex vertebrates. Zoologists explore various aspects of animal life, aiming to understand the
      diversity and interconnectedness of the animal kingdom.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Classification:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Classification is the process of categorizing animals into different groups based on their
      evolutionary relationships and shared characteristics. It involves identifying and classifying animals into
      hierarchical taxonomic ranks, such as phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Animal
      classification provides a framework for organizing and studying the immense diversity of animal species.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Anatomy:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Anatomy is the study of the structure and organization of animal bodies. It explores the arrangement
      of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems in various animal species. Animal anatomical studies help in
      understanding the functional adaptations of animals to their environment and their specific physiological
      processes.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Physiology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Physiology focuses on the study of the functions and processes that occur within animal bodies. It
      investigates how animals carry out essential life functions such as respiration, digestion, circulation,
      excretion, and reproduction. Animal physiology helps in understanding the mechanisms that allow animals to
      survive, adapt, and thrive in different environments.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Behavior:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Behavior is the study of how animals interact with each other and their environment. It explores
      various aspects of animal behavior, including communication, mating systems, social behavior, foraging
      patterns, and migration. Animal behavior provides insights into the ecological roles of animals, their
      adaptations, and their evolutionary strategies.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Ecology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Ecology studies the relationships between animals and their environment. It investigates the
      distribution, abundance, and interactions of animals in different ecosystems. Animal ecologists explore
      topics such as population dynamics, community structure, energy flow, and the conservation of animal species
      and their habitats.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Evolution:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Evolution examines the evolutionary history and relationships of animals. It explores the origins of
      animal life, the diversification of animal forms, and the processes that have shaped the animal kingdom over
      millions of years. Animal evolution provides insights into the patterns of biodiversity and the mechanisms
      of evolutionary change.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Reproduction:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Reproduction focuses on the mechanisms by which animals reproduce and produce offspring. It explores
      various reproductive strategies, mating behaviors, and reproductive anatomy and physiology in different
      animal groups. Animal reproduction plays a vital role in species survival, genetic diversity, and the
      continuation of life cycles.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Animal Diversity:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-
            
            3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Animal Diversity refers to the vast array of animal species that exist on Earth. It encompasses the
      incredible range of forms, sizes, habitats, and behaviors exhibited by animals across different taxonomic
      groups. Animal diversity highlights the remarkable adaptations and evolutionary innovations that have
      emerged throughout the history of life on our planet.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Invertebrate Zoology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Invertebrate Zoology is the study of animals without a vertebral column, including insects, mollusks,
      crustaceans, worms, and many other groups. It explores the diversity, anatomy, physiology, behavior, and
      ecological roles of invertebrate animals. Invertebrate zoology plays a crucial role in understanding the
      majority of animal species and their contributions to ecosystems.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Vertebrate Zoology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Vertebrate Zoology focuses on the study of animals with a vertebral column, including fishes, amphibians,
      reptiles, birds, and mammals. It explores the diversity, anatomy, physiology, behavior, and evolutionary
      relationships of vertebrate animals. Vertebrate zoology provides insights into the adaptations and
      ecological roles of vertebrates and their significance in ecosystems.
