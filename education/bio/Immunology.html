    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Introduction to Immunology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immunology is the branch of biology that deals with the study of the immune system, which is responsible for
      protecting the body against infectious agents and foreign substances. It explores the structure and function
      of the immune system, including its cells, tissues, organs, and molecules. Immunology plays a crucial role
      in understanding immunity, immune responses, and the development of vaccines and therapeutics.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Components of the Immune System:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      The immune system consists of various components that work together to defend the body against pathogens and
      foreign invaders. These components include white blood cells, such as lymphocytes, phagocytes, and
      antigen-presenting cells, as well as specialized molecules, such as antibodies and cytokines. Understanding
      the components of the immune system is essential for comprehending immune responses and immune-related
      diseases.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Immune Responses:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immune responses are the body's coordinated defense mechanisms against pathogens and other foreign
      substances. They involve the recognition, activation, and deployment of immune cells and molecules to
      eliminate or neutralize the threat. Immune responses can be categorized into innate immunity, which provides
      immediate but nonspecific defense, and adaptive immunity, which is specific and can generate immunological
      memory.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Antibodies and Antigens:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by the immune system in response to the
      presence of antigens, which are substances that can trigger an immune response. Antibodies specifically
      recognize and bind to antigens, marking them for destruction by other immune cells. The study of antibodies
      and antigens is essential for understanding immune recognition and the development of diagnostic and
      therapeutic tools.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Cell-Mediated Immunity:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Cell-mediated immunity is a branch of the immune response that involves the activation and coordination of
      various immune cells, such as T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It plays a crucial role in eliminating
      intracellular pathogens, including viruses and certain bacteria, as well as in recognizing and destroying
      abnormal or infected host cells. Cell-mediated immunity is vital for both protection and immunopathology.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Humoral Immunity:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Humoral immunity refers to the immune response mediated by antibodies and other soluble factors present in
      the body fluids, such as blood and lymph. It provides defense against extracellular pathogens, toxins, and
      allergens. Humoral immunity involves the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes, their secretion into the
      bloodstream, and their interactions with antigens to neutralize or eliminate the threats.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Immune System Disorders:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immune system disorders are conditions in which the immune system fails to function properly, leading to
      immune deficiencies or inappropriate immune responses. Examples of immune system disorders include
      autoimmune diseases, allergies, immunodeficiencies, and hypersensitivity reactions. The study of immune
      system disorders is essential for diagnosis, treatment, and the development of therapies to

      modulate immune responses.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Immunotherapy:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immunotherapy is a branch of medicine that harnesses the power of the immune system to treat or prevent
      diseases, particularly cancer, autoimmune disorders, and allergies. It involves the use of various
      strategies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and adoptive cell therapies, to
      enhance or modulate immune responses against specific targets. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the field of
      medicine and offers promising new treatment options.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Vaccines:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Vaccines are biological preparations that stimulate the immune system to recognize and remember specific
      pathogens, providing immunity against future infections. They typically contain weakened or inactivated
      forms of the pathogen or specific antigens derived from the pathogen. Vaccination has been a powerful tool
      in preventing and eradicating infectious diseases, saving millions of lives worldwide.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Transplantation Immunology:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Transplantation immunology deals with the study of immune responses to transplanted organs, tissues, or
      cells. It focuses on understanding the mechanisms of graft rejection and the development of strategies to
      prevent or manage transplant rejection. Transplantation immunology plays a vital role in the field of organ
      transplantation and the improvement of transplant outcomes.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Immunological Techniques:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immunological techniques are laboratory methods used to study the immune system and its responses. These
      techniques include immunoassays, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blotting, and various
      molecular biology techniques. Immunological techniques are essential for diagnosing immune-related
      disorders, monitoring immune responses, and advancing immunological research.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Immunogenetics:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immunogenetics is the study of the genetic basis of the immune system, including the genes that encode
      immune molecules, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. It explores how genetic
      variations contribute to individual differences in immune responses, susceptibility to diseases, and the
      development of personalized immunotherapies. Immunogenetics has significant implications in transplantation,
      disease susceptibility, and vaccine development.
    </div>

    <h1 class="text-center"><b>Immunological Memory:</b></h1>
    <div class="p-3 mb-2 bg-primary text-white">
      Immunological memory refers to the ability of the immune system to remember and respond more effectively to
      previously encountered pathogens or antigens. It is the basis for long-term immunity following infection or
      vaccination. Immunological memory is mediated by specialized immune cells called memory B cells and memory T
      cells, which mount a rapid and robust response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen or antigen.
